# Vermillion

Vermillion is a javascript framework for building web applications.
It makes building an interactive UI simple but powerful.
This framework is built to be simple and easy to understand for developers.
It is not using a virtual dom,
instead it will attache a watcher to a bindings and update it only when necessary.
This feature is what makes it very fast and have a better client run-time performance and memory efficient than virtual dom.
