# Installation

Maf.js cli helps developers to create a working application out of the box.
It has many useful commands like generating files for our maf.js app.

To install the cli we just need to run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g maf.js-cli
```

After installing the cli, we can verify if the installation is a success by running the following command:

```bash
maf --version
```

If the installation is a success it should display the version of the maf.js-cli installed in your machine.

We can find help with the cli using the `maf.js --help` command.

We can now start creating our new maf.js project by running this command:

```bash
maf new my-maf.js-app
```

The syntax of the command above is `maf <command> <project name>` where "new" is the command and "my-maf.js-app" is the project name.
